#Using this dataset of 32 variables measuring the size and shape of cell nuclei, 
#goal is to create a model that will allow us to predict whether a breast cancer cell is benign or malignant.

#Data Description
#Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. 
#They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. Our dataset consists of 569 observations and 32 variables. 
#There is an ID variable, a diagnosis variable revealing if they were benign or malignant,
#and 30 measurement variables detailing the size and shape of the cell nuclei. 
#The diagnosis, a categorical variable, is our response variable and the 30 measurement variables, all of which are continuous, 
#are our potential explanatory variables for our model. 
#The 30 measurement variables are actually only 10 different features of the nucleus, but with 3 different measurements of each; 
#the mean, the standard error and the ‘worst’ or largest (mean of the three largest values). 
#radius - mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter
#texture - standard deviation of gray-scale values
#perimeter
#area
#smoothness - local variation in radius lengths
#compactness - perimeter^2 / area - 1.0
#concavity - severity of concave portions of the contour
#concave points - number of concave portions of the contour
#symmetry
#fractal dimension - “coastline approximation” - 1

#check missing data
missing_values <- df %>% summarize_all(funs(sum(is.na(.))/n()))

missing_values <- gather(missing_values, key="feature", value="missing_pct")

missing_values %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=reorder(feature,-missing_pct),y=missing_pct)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity",fill="red")+
  coord_flip()+theme_bw()

#Let's start the model by split the data into train/test set

#First, we need to split the data into 
set.seed(123)
# Put 80% of the data into the training set 
data_split <- initial_split(df, prop = 4/5)

# Create data frames for the two sets:
train_data <- training(data_split)
test_data  <- testing(data_split)

# create a recipe
class_rec <- 
  recipe(diagnosis~ ., data = train_data) %>%
  #step_string2factor(diagnosis)
  update_role(id, new_role = 'ID')
# the recipe function has two arguments here, first is a formula, anything on the left hand side is considered the model outcome. 
# we also update the roles here to use the update_role function to indicate the want to assign "ID" to our column id, which tells the
# recipe to not use them as either outcomes or input.
